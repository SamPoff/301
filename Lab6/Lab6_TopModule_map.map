WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net D_Con/led_clock/outClk is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   118 out of   2,278    5%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       148 out of   4,556    3%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          375
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           258 out of     375   68%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  25 out of     375    6%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          92 out of     375   24%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              21 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
